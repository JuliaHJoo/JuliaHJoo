From reading *How to be a Modern Scientist by Jeff Leek*, I have learned tips on the practice of being a good scientist that are often not taught explicitly in academic courses, but are often left up to individuals pursuing in academic career to figure out in bits and pieces on their own. The book discussed several topics that were helpful, ranging from best practices for writing a manuscript to career planning in academia. One of the most helpful parts of the book was the section explaining the process of peer review of manuscripts by journals. Even after having been a first author on scientific papers in the past, wherein I had to field reviewers' comments and quesitons about my work, I didn't truly understand the standards that most reviewers abide by until I read this book. My key takeaways, both from the perspective of having my manuscript be reviewed and being a future peer reviewer, were the following:

- You should never take more than a month to review (which gave me some justification at being annoyed with reviewers who take ages to return a time-sensitive manuscript).
- Don't be a "jerk reviewer". In other words, don't ask for revisions and waste the authors' time if you wouldn't accept the manuscript even if they made the changes requested.
-It is totally valid to get credit for peer reviewing papers (through platforms such as Publons). This makes sense to me because performing a good review takes lots of time and effort and receiving credit for this work would incentivize more scientists to be reviewers.

The book also strongly recommended creating an online presence and identity to promote one's career. This idea was, and still is, quite daunting to me. The internet is a scary place and I would generally like to stay far away from the vitriolic arguments that can place on social media over controversial scientific findings. However, I would like to lean into the new age of scientific discourse, much of which now happens online and in public forums. I do have a twitter account already and will try to at least be more active in following journals that publicize their newly published articles and promote the articles I'm most excited about.
