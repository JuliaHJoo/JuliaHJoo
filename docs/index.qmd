# Biography

I am an M4 at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine (CCLCM), an MD program with a particular emphasis on training physician-scientists. I am interested in pursuing ophthalmology, which a particular interest in the ocular manifestations of neurodegeneration, such as optic neuritis and glaucoma. I am fascinated by research questions in both the basic science/translational and clinical research realms and have been involved in a broad spectrum of projects throughout my training.

I am also passionate about using my platform and resources as a medical student to address the health disparities in the Greater Cleveland area. As the Student Lead of the Service Learning & Community Outreach action group at CCLCM, I helped start a student-run health clinic at the Haven Home, a temporary housing shelter for women and children experiencing homelessness, as well as a comprehensive health curriculum for students grades 6-8 at a local elementary school. Both projects have continued to flourish and expand over the past two years!

In my spare time, I enjoy traveling to national parks, singing, and exploring food spots around Cleveland!
